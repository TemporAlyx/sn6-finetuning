# sn6-finetuning
 Training scripts and other utilities for NousResearch's finetuning subnet/competition

 See the comments in the training.py file for more information on some of the custom options I was using.
 Feel free to @ me for questions in the discord server.

 I may come back to this later to rewrite a few things that I think I could have done cleaner (especially remerging/reverting), or possibly writing an alternate Trainer for LORA training. And I have considered doing a write up on all the things I tried and papers I read, but other than that this code is provided as is, the requirements.txt is more of a guideline as pytorch needs to be tailored to cuda versions and such.
